Yuanqi Du is a CS PhD student at Cornell University, working on the intersection of AI and Science, advised by Prof. Carla P. Gomes. In the past, he spent time at AMLab at University of Amsterdam advised by Prof. Max Welling and DP Technology supervised by Dr. Linfeng Zhang. He also spent time at Microsoft Research Asia, Machine Learning group. He is a passionate community builder, which he founded the series of [*AI for Science workshops*](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), co-founded the [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/), and led an initiative [*AI for Science 101*](https://ai4science101.github.io/) building knowledge systems for AI for Science. He maintains a slack channel for AI for Science, feel free to join and say Hi to people [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aiforscience/shared_invite/zt-1bdof1jmf-YtIjkUVA5DquXguEiOXGPQ)!

## Research Interests
  * ***Probabilistic Machine Learning***: Generative Models (includ. Large Language Models), Optimal Transport, Stochastic Control, Sampling 
  * ***Structure and Geometry***: Neural Architectures (e.g. Graphs and Sets), Equivariance, Symmetry, Tensor Networks
  * ***AI for Science***: Molecular Design, Molecular Simulation, Chemical Reaction and Synthesis

Additional topics I am interested in include: (Mechanistic) Interpretability, Science of Science, and Societal Impact of AI.

* What's next?
* 3/24 I wrote a short [blog post](https://medium.com/@yuanqidu/about-academic-event-organization-and-community-building-in-ai-and-ml-0735893d7e36) to share some personal lessons, experienecs and thoughts about organizing academic events and community building. 
* 3/24 We are organizing the new AI for Science edition ([Scaling in AI for Scientific Discovery](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/icml24.html)) and [Structured Probabilsitic Inference and Generative Modeling](https://spigmworkshop2024.github.io/) workshops with ICML 2024!
* 2/24 We are organizing an AI for Science Seminar (livestreaming, free-to-attend for all and physically at Cornell)! [Schedule](https://science.ai.cornell.edu/events/ai-for-science-seminar-series-spring-2024/), [Zoom link](https://t.co/6sMdN7NuCm), [Recordings](https://www.youtube.com/@cuaisci)
* 1/24 We released a blog [AI for Science in 2023: A Community Primer](https://medium.com/@AI_for_Science/ai-for-science-in-2023-a-community-primer-d2c2db37e9a7) to highlight some progress and trends in the broad AI for Science community, check it out!
* [AI for Science101](https://ai4science101.github.io/) is an educational initative with community contributed series of blogs and short tutorials for broad topics in the intersection of AI and Science. -->
